STEPS OF TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND MINING
==========================================

1) Geth client calculates a seed for each block.
2) From the seed, a pseudorandom cache is calculated.
3) From cache, a dataset is generated.
4) Mining involves taking random slices of the dataset and hashing them together.


DIFFERENT SCENARIOS EXECUTED AS PART OF THE PROJECT
====================================================================

1) When there is a gap between last valid transaction nonce and current nonce, the transaction goes into the transaction pool queue and does not get mined.

In the code, nonce is incremented by two, and the two transactions are submitted. Later, transaction with nonce value in the gap is submitted.


2) From one account maximum number of transactions permitted is 64
